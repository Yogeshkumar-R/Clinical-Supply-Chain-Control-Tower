# Clinical-Supply-Chain-Control-Tower

**Global Pharma Inc.** manages complex clinical trials across 50+ countries. Currently, their supply chain data is fragmented across 40+ disparate tables (SAP dumps, SharePoint lists, Excel trackers). Supply Managers are overwhelmed by manual data reconciliation, leading to two major risks:
1.  **Stock-outs:** Patients not getting medication because enrollment spiked unexpectedly.
2.  **Waste:** High-value drugs expiring in warehouses because no one noticed they could be re-allocated or life-extended.
